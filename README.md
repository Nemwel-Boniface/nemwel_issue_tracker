# Nemwel Issue Tracker

Nemwel's Issue Tracker is a valuable tool for managing and organizing various challenges and requests that arise during a project's lifecycle. It provides a structured way to capture, track, and resolve issues, ultimately leading to increased efficiency, improved collaboration, and better project outcomes.

This application will help me practice:
1. The REST framework by implementing CRUD operations for adding, deleting, and updating data.
2. Writing integrated unit tests using the [Minitest](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) library for unit tests for my app controllers.
3. The Ruby on Rails [MVC](https://www.bogotobogo.com/RubyOnRails/RubyOnRails_Model_View_Controller_MVC.php). pattern, focusing on Models and Controllers to handle business logic and data processing.
4. Project documentation by writing a detailed README upon completion to help others understand and use my project.
5. Project deployment making use of [render](https://render.com/) which will host my application.

## How to test the application

## Future Features
Development of this application follows a Kanban Board, which helps track tasks across different stages i.e Done, In Progress, In Review, and Pending. You can view the board and stay updated on ongoing improvements through [this GitHub project](https://github.com/users/Nemwel-Boniface/projects/10).
